# Task Scheduler Dashboard

Small personal project for using Golang, Docker, and Kubernetes. Inspired by [this](https://www.callicoder.com/deploy-containerized-go-app-kubernetes/)

### Notes

#### Docker

Dockerfile is commented to provide explanation of each layer.

Starting with the command `docker build -t gokubedash .`  

This builds the image using the Dockerfile, whilst tagging it as _'gokubedash'_, everything from the current directory, which is not part of the .dockerignore, is included in the image.

_(This may not have been entirely necessary upon reflection, as you can add multiple tags in the previous step.)_  


The resulting image was then tagged with _jdockerty/gokubedash:1.1_ as this provides the _jdockerty/_ namespace in a DockerHub. `docker tag gokubedash jdockerty/gokubedash:1.1`  


The image was then run as a container to test that it was functioning properly. This maps the localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080, to the port which is exposed from the container, which is also 8080. `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 gokubedash`

After this, I pushed the image to DockerHub for use with Kubernetes. `docker push jdockerty/gokubedash:1.1`

### Kubernetes
Beforehand, I had to install [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) and [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/). Kubernetes is for running containers at scale and Minikube is so that a Kubernetes cluster can be run locally.

The process begins with `minikube start`

A YAML file, known as a manifest, is used to start Kubernetes deployments. This is the _k8sconfig.yml_ file.

To begin the K8s deployment, we issue the command `kubectl apply -f k8sconfig.yml`, the -f flag is used to denote the file we are using for our deployment's configuration. This applies our resources, the deployment and a service.

We can see the deployments using the command `kubectl get deployments`, of which the output shown below.

The pods can also be seen using the command `kubectl get pods`.

Since the pods within the cluster cannot be accessed from outside, by default, we must port-forward one of the pods to test it is working. `kubectl port-forward gokubedash-6bf64bdc89-4r89s 8080:8080`

We can then visit localhost:8080 to test whether it is working properly.

Kubernetes allows for very fast scaling, we increase the number of pods that are running by issuing the command 

`kubectl scale --replicas=5 deployment/gokubedash` 

We initial set the number of pods (replicas) to 3, so now we are scaling it to 5 with a single command.
